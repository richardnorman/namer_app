# namer_app
<<<<<<< HEAD
This project was lead by Google CodeLabs for Dart.

Namer App is a simple Flutter application that generates random word pairs using the english_words package. Users can like (favorite) word pairs and view their list of favorites. The app features a clean interface with navigation between the word generator and favorites list, and uses the Provider package for state management. The main screen displays a large card with the current word pair, and users can generate new pairs or add them to their favorites with a single tap.
